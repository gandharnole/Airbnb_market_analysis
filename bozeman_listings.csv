Welcome to Montana. I was born and raised on a working horse ranch in the heart of Paradise Valley, specifically Tom Miner Basin along the banks of the Yellowstone River. My parents continue to thrive on the ranch while my siblings and I went out into the world to pursue educations and other interests. My love for Montana brought me home in 2012, when I launched my vacation rental management business- MonTanya Yellowstone Properties & Concierge.

I'm based in Livingston and look forward to welcoming and accommodating you in southwest Montana.",within an hour,100%,100%,t,https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/user/d0839dc6-ba8a-42f0-9d23-64f8ea599fc3.jpg?aki_policy=profile_small,https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/user/d0839dc6-ba8a-42f0-9d23-64f8ea599fc3.jpg?aki_policy=profile_x_medium,,18,27,"['email', 'phone']",t,t,,Bozeman,,45.670395,-111.007668,Entire vacation home,Entire home/apt,4,2.5,2.5 baths,2,2,"[""Long term stays allowed"", ""Hangers"", ""Hair dryer"", ""Central air conditioning"", ""Wine glasses"", ""Bluetooth sound system"", ""Hot water kettle"", ""Fire pit"", ""Smoke alarm"", ""Outdoor furniture"", ""Room-darkening shades"", ""Dining table"", ""Outdoor dining area"", ""Free washer \u2013 In unit"", ""BBQ grill"", ""Blender"", ""Hot water"", ""Fire extinguisher"", ""Coffee"", ""Private backyard \u2013 Not fully fenced"", ""Free dryer \u2013 In unit"", ""Extra pillows and blankets"", ""Bed linens"", ""Private patio or balcony"", ""Dedicated workspace"", ""Refrigerator"", ""65 inch HDTV"", ""Stainless steel electric stove"", ""Conditioner"", ""Cleaning products"", ""Mountain view"", ""Dishes and silverware"", ""Dishwasher"", ""Essentials"", ""Free parking on premises"", ""Carbon monoxide alarm"", ""Kitchen"", ""Luggage dropoff allowed"", ""Shampoo"", ""Barbecue utensils"", ""Cooking basics"", ""Oven"", ""Iron"", ""Microwave"", ""Coffee maker"", ""Baking sheet"", ""Clothing storage: walk-in closet, closet, and dresser"", ""Self check-in"", ""Laundromat nearby"", ""Keypad"", ""Private entrance"", ""Freezer"", ""Toaster"", ""Wifi"", ""Central heating"", ""Shower gel"", ""Body soap""]",$186.00,2,1125,2,2,1125,1125,2.0,1125.0,,t,26,39,53,131,2025-10-17,48,23,5,47,19,138,25668,2023-05-12,2025-10-12,4.96,4.98,4.92,5.0,5.0,4.94,4.94,STR23-00046,t,1,1,0,0,1.62

We are originally from Connecticut and have lots of family there that we visit regularly. I’ve been back in Bozeman full time for about 8 years and love all the many activities MT has to offer including skiing, snow shoeing, hiking, cycling, camping, tennis, pickleball, yoga  and so much more. 

I have two sons, one who graduated from the US Naval Academy Annapolis and is now a Marine Officer stationed at Camp Lejeune in North Carolina. The other graduated from University College London, England Medical School and is currently working as a doctor in London and is a competitive rower. 

I’m busy managing my rental properties located on the edge of the MSU campus and our lovely Yellow Dogs guest Cottage along with working as a Property Manager for others. 

Our Yellow Dogs are named Rumo & Tater.  You will occasionally see them playing and chasing balls in the fenced in backyard.

During that time our family lived abroad in Lugano, Switzerland, and then Surrey, England for over 9 years, returning to our home once or twice a year to stay in touch with lovely Bozeman and our wonderful local friends. We are originally from Connecticut and have lots of family there that we visit regularly. I’ve been back in Bozeman full time for about 8 years and love all the many activities MT has to offer including skiing, snow shoeing, hiking, cycling, camping, tennis, pickleball, yoga  and so much more. 

I have two sons, one who graduated from the US Naval Academy Annapolis and is now a Marine Officer stationed at Camp Lejeune in North Carolina. The other graduated from University College London, England Medical School and is currently working as a doctor in London and is a competitive rower. 

I’m busy managing my rental properties located on the edge of the MSU campus and our lovely Yellow Dogs guest Cottage along with working as a Property Manager for others. 

Our Yellow Dogs are named Rumo & Tater.  You will occasionally see them playing and chasing balls in the fenced in backyard.

I love spaces so much that I got into Real Estate,  and now I get to visit new spaces for a living. 

So of course when I travel I like to visit not only new cities and places, but also new houses and spaces.  Unfortunately I’ve been too busy working on various projects over the past few years to travel much, but I escape when I can!!

I’m also in the process of acquiring a place to build my own dream vacation cabin - which I will be happily sharing with the BNB community in the (semi-near-ish) future.  

That said, a few things about me... I love the “golden rule,” hate ignorance; love skiing and hiking, hate the ugly boots that go with them; love reading books, hate getting older and (almost) needing reading glasses; love karma, hate when it catches up to someone too late ;).  

I appreciate anyone who shares their space with me, and promise to treat it as I would my own - ie I’ll leave my boots at the door before I go curl up with a good book in the comfiest chair.
